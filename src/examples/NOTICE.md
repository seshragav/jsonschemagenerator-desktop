# Example Schemas (`/src/examples`)

This directory contains three fully-worked sample schemas, together with
optional helper assets under `examples/assets/`.

| Schema file           | Purpose / demo focus                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **helloworld.json**   | Minimal “hello-world” schema; ships with a small React demo app in `assets/helloworld/app/`.                           |
| **labresults.json**   | Nested medical example that models patient lab-result reports.                                                         |
| **10q.json**          | Extracts structured highlights from a public company’s quarterly 10-Q filing.                                          |

All examples are **synthetic**—no real patient or corporate data is included.
