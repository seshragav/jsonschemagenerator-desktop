# Privacy Policy for AI Structured Output Designer

_Last updated: 14 May 2025_

**Local-first application**  
AI Structured Output Designer (“the App”) runs entirely on your device.  
The App **does not transmit** prompts, model output, telemetry, or personal data to any external server operated by the developer.

**Open-source exception**  
When you voluntarily create a GitHub issue, pull request, or discussion in the public repository, you may choose to share log files or screenshots. That personal information is **public by nature**; please redact sensitive data before posting.

**Third-party APIs**  
If you connect the App to an LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI), the request is sent **directly from your machine to that provider** under their privacy terms. We do not store or intercept those requests.

**Crash logs**  
The App uses no built-in analytics or crash reporter.  
Windows may collect minimal diagnostic data under its own privacy statement.
