# StructOut Designer

*Version 0.1.0 — May 14 2025*

**StructOut Designer** is a three-pane workspace that helps you craft
machine-readable JSON-schema prompts for Large-Language-Model APIs.

| Feature  | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| *Explorer* | Browse saved templates and built-in examples. |
| *Schema Designer* | Visual tree-grid editor with drag-to-reorder, inline type pickers, and real-time validation. |
| *Schema Panel* | Instant JSON-schema preview plus provider-specific header rule injection (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, …). |
| *Dual-target build* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Runs as a web app (Vite) **and** a native desktop app (Tauri/WebView2). |
| *Open source* | MIT-licensed; source at <https://github.com/seshragav/structout>. |
| *IDE Helpers* | One-click code-gen that writes a typed Pydantic model (`*_model.py`), a ready-to-run stub (`main.py`), and helper files (`schema.json`, sample content) every time you hit **Save**—so your editor has autocompletion and runtime validation out of the box. |
