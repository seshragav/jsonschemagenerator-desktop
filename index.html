  Purpose
    Single-page entry for *StructOut Designer*.
    • The <script type="module"> tag is rewritten by Vite’s dev-server
      and by the build pipeline—keep the leading “/”.
    • /tauri.js is only required when the bundle is wrapped by Tauri;
      it harmlessly 404s (and is ignored) in regular browser mode.
